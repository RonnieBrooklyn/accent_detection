# Accent AI 

### About
Advances in machine learning have made video and audio processing much easier. It puts accent detection in audio within reach. 
Can it identify what accent someone is speaking and what about their voice profile identifies them as such? 
This project aims to train and deploy a machine learning model to answer this question. 

### Dataset
All of the speech files used for this project come from the Speech Accent Archive, a repository of spoken English hosted by George Mason University. Over 2000 speakers representing over 100 native languages read a common elicitation paragraph in English:

```
'Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the store: Six spoons of fresh
snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need 
a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. She can scoop these things into three red 
bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.'
```
